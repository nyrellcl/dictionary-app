## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my Dictionary App Repo!


## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dictionary web app using the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field(DONE)
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word(DONE)
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form(DONE)
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available(DONE)
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts(DONE; needs styling work)
- Switch between light and dark themes(DONE)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size(DONE)
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page(DONE; styling work)
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## Notes

- The API will sometimes return multiple items for a word, phonetics, and audio file. Choose to handle this however you feel is best.(DONE)
- The source URL should open a new window in the browser(DONE)

## Reflection
Building this application was a really informative experience and gave me further insight at my current skill level as a front-end developer.

Building more projects that included API integrations and form validations helped to also validate my own skills as I completed this project. It also helped highlight areas where I still need to learn more on and areas where I know of already, but supplying it with more information could prove to be beneficial as well.

Given that an API is being used, for best practices I wanted to abstract away the API logic from the client-side logic. That way, it allows for future updates to the API to be handled in one single file. I also decided to structure the API
